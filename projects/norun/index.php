            <h1 class="projects" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Why create a new social network? <span class="project-title">Norun</span></h1>
            <p class="top">It is highly likely that the business model of social networks is not sustainable in the long term. The competition for users' attention slowly undermines the entire structure of our society, from physical/mental to social/professional aspects.</p>
            <p>Norun's challenge is to understand the best way to structure a new model of social network. This is one of the most difficult problems I have worked on, but it is very important.</p>

            </ul>
            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 6rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Define the problem</h1>
            <p class="top">In this phase, I focused on closely observing how social networks fit into people's lives. I noticed that when trying to start a conversation, people quickly become defensive and do not share their thoughts on the subject.</p>
            <p class="top">The main problems defined were the unlimited amount of content, monetization model, irrelevant push notifications, and comparison metrics between users.</p>
            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Imagine solutions</h1>
            <p class="top">I talked several times with friends and other people interested in the project to refine my initial ideas. The photo below is the first draft we made.</p>
            <img src="../../assets/norun-ideas.jpg" style="width: inherit; margin-top: 1rem;" />
            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Plan</h1>
            <p class="top">The initial plan was to develop an MVP and get feedback as soon as possible. I created a page to capture emails of interested people and sent it to several friends.</p>
            <img src="../../assets/norun-page.jpg" style="width: inherit; margin-top: 1rem;" />
            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Prototype</h1>
            <p class="top">I tried to convince two programmer friends to join the project and code the MVP, but both were busy with many projects and college work.</p>
            <p class="top">Therefore, I had to learn how to create apps. I knew it would take longer than planned, but it was the best option. I spent 2 months learning a little about Firebase, Flutter, and Node.js on YouTube and Udemy. After those 2 months, I spent another month implementing what I learned and launched the first Beta version of Norun.</p>
            <p class="top">The images below are design process prints, from the beginning to the launch version.</p>

            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Testing</h1>
            <p class="top">I received important feedback from the people who left their email on that first page I created. I fixed about 50 bugs in the first two weeks after launch and listed some improvements to work on in the following weeks.</p>
            <h1 class="projects" style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 5rem; margin-bottom: 1.7rem;">Improving</h1>
            <p class="top" style="margin-bottom: 5rem;">There are still many improvements to be made, but you always have to go back to the first topic of the process: 'Understanding the problem', because everything is constantly changing.</p>
